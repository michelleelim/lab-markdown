## Lab Reflection
>I realized there were some Python syntax that I became rusty on, such as splitting code, and had to understand it again in order to complete the stretch for lab 2. 


## Code Snippet 
'''python 
num1_str, operator, num2_str = parts
num1 = float(num1_str)
num2 = float(num2_str)
'''
